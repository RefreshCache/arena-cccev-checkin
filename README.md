This custom module is co-developed by the [Webologists](http://www.centralaz.com/Arena/default.aspx?page=4647) at [Central Christian Church](http://www.centralaz.com) and the dev team at [High Desert Church](http://www.highdesertchurch.com).

This Arena Module uses the underlying Arena check-in framework (Attendance Types, Occurrences, etc.) and some custom code that provides extended attributes for Attendance Types. Note: This is the live, production Children's check-in system at both Central Christian Church and High Desert Church.

It is _not_ an exhaustive replacement for the existing Arena check-in system.  This check-in wizard only does what _it_ does (Arena's system has other functionality that we consider extraneous and therefore unnecessary for what we wanted to accomplish.)

**Features:**

*   100% web browser based! (works on an iPad or in Safari on a mac)
*   check-in multiple people at once
*   check-in to multiple, upcoming services at once
*   check-in "related" people via any Arena relationship types you choose
*   check-in by ability level (infant, crawler, walker, etc.) or "special needs" flag
*   supports "room balancing" to allow you to load balance rooms of the same class type
*   able to require membership (via linked Arena tag) in order to check-in to a class
*   support for "at kiosk" or "at location" label printing
*   supports MS Reporting Services printed labels or extendable via built in provider model (IPrintLabel) usage
*   100% skinnable via your own stylesheet

**IMPORTANT NOTE: Version 1.4.x is _NOT_ compatible with Arena version 2012.X nor is it compatible with Arena 2011.2**

**NOTE: This project depends on the following projects:**

*   CCCEV Framework Utils
*   CCCEV Data Utils*   Arena version 2011.1 or earlier.
